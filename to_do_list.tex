Ex-ante Lobbying

\vskip.2in
\begin{itemize}
	\item Need to convey the possibilities of this set-up for capturing the real life dynamics of shocks integrated with lobbying dynamics, how that interacts with enforcement and administered protection
	\item Supply air tight argument / reference about $C+aW$ being equivalent to $\ga$ increasing everywhere
		\begin{itemize}
			\item CAN'T! It's not true! Only microfound a version with $1+a$ on those who lobby, $a$ on those who don't
		\end{itemize}
	\item perhaps re-emphasize that gov't can't completely control lobbying: can't make it higher than lobby's optimal. But this is b/c there's only one lobby
	\item finish escape clause result
	\item re-write intro
		\begin{itemize}
			\item MRC-style results survive incorporation of ex-ante lobbying. TA still works to restrict lobbying in many cases, but also to keep lobbyists ``in the game''
			\item Baldwin-style gov't welfare function works for a set of questions, but not for this one
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Need to be able to say which predictions/design questions are okay: those that don't change lobbying incentives
				\end{itemize}
			\item In MRC, weight on lobby's profits is $1+a$ no matter what. Doesn't vary in lobby's efforts. GH not really microfoundations for flexible model as in Long and Vousden (1991) / Baldwin (1987) model; microfoundations for more restrictive version with fixed weights; then decide $\tau$ to change PS, CS, etc. (p. 481 GH94). Can't get shocks as in this literature
			\item Coates and Ludema (2001)---endogenous (add to list of GH, MRC)
			\item How do I want to sell the paper? In relation to what literature? (what lit does endogenous? what lit doesn't?)
			\item What if the WTO actually \textit{did} what the literature says it does? It wouldn't work
			\item Be more explicit about relationship between $\ga(e)$ and $\ga(s)$
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\vskip.5in
For after this draft
\begin{itemize}
	\item Could escape clause be made to work with some kind of dynamic use constraint?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item When would lobby exert effort to top up?
		\end{itemize}
	\item What units are $\pi(\tau)$ and $e$ measured in? (no numeraire)
	\item existence proofs
\end{itemize}
