In many situations, it is realistic to assume that, in addition to the ex-post lobbying examined throughout this text, lobbying also takes place before the trade agreement is signed to affect the terms of the trade agreement. To reiterate what has been shown in previous sections, although ex-post lobbying occurs after the trade agreement is signed in order to impact the level of the applied tariff, it alters the incentives of governments when they negotiate the trade agreement. Similarly, ex-ante lobbying is aimed directly at changing the level of the trade agreement tariff, but here lobbies only engage in this activity in order to alter what will be possible ex-post.

With the addition of the possibility of ex-ante lobbying, the lobby may have to pay twice. As in Section~\ref{sec:strong}, when facing a trade agreement in which commitments take the form of strong bindings, the lobby's optimal ex-post effort choice is zero. However, when facing a tariff cap, protection will only be supplied at the ex-post stage if the lobby exerts effort. Thus, ex-ante lobbying adds a second time at which the lobby may have an incentive to exert effort in the case of a tariff cap; it introduces a first time at which the lobby may supply non-zero effort in the case of a strong binding.

For simplicity, here I consider ex-ante lobbying when political pressure is endogenous only, i.e. there is no exogenous, probabilistic influence on $\ga$. Since there is no possibility of ex-ante lobbying in the \Textcite{bs2005} framework this paper follows, it must be determined how ex-ante lobbying can best be integrated into the model.

\Textcite{bs2005} posits that governments negotiate the trade agreement so that they will be able to set the applied tariff that best matches the political pressure they experience ex-post. In the case of endogenous political pressure, I have argued that the governments will tune the trade agreement to deliver the amount of lobbying effort that is in their best interest ex-post. How does this change when lobbies can influence the terms of the trade agreement?

In the case of lobbies, a lobby knows that the trade agreement will bind its future action, so exerting effort at the ex-ante stage only matters insofar as it improves ex-post profits net of both ex-ante and ex-post lobbying effort. For the governments, with ex-post pressure only, the governments are completely forward looking: they set the trade agreement with a view toward maximizing expected joint ex-post welfare. In order for ex-ante lobbying to have an effect, it must be that governments also receive some utility from the setting of the trade agreement itself: perhaps they receive or lose political capital from various interested parties, and can be persuaded to forego future benefits if ex-ante lobbying is strong enough to outweigh those future concerns. 

Thus I model the influence of ex-ante lobbying on the governments' tariff-setting behavior as operating through a threshold. Recall how the trade agreement tariff is determined under ex-post lobbying only. Because the trade agreement acts as a commitment device, the governments choose the tariff level $\tau^R_{\cdot,e}$, and implicitly $e^{EP}=e^R_{\cdot,e}$, to maximize their joint political welfare as in Equation~\ref{exp:1}, subject only to the constraint that $\ga$ will be realized according to the ex-post lobbying process.
		
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:objfcn}, depending on how government welfare changes as political pressure increases, the governments may be looking ahead and manipulating ex-post lobbying incentives when there is only ex-post lobbying. When ex-ante lobbying is possible the governments may have to raise the trade agreement tariff above $\tau^R_{\cdot,e}$ in order to respond to that pressure.

This is modeled here with a simple cut-off. The trade agreement tariff cap will be set according to $\ga\left(e^{EA}\right)$ instead of at $\tau^R_{\cdot,e}$ if $\ga\left(e^{EA}\right)$ would lead to a higher trade agreement tariff. If, on the other hand, $\tau = \frac{4(\ga(e^{EA})-1)}{25-4\ga(e^{EA})} < \tau^R_{\cdot,e}$, the governments respond to the higher ex-post pressure and set $\tau^R_{\cdot,e}$.

Thus the governments lose some measure of control with ex-ante lobbying. If $e^{EA}$ is low enough, ex-ante lobbying has no impact. But if $e^{EA}$ is above the threshold, the trade agreement tariff is strictly greater than $\tau^R_{\cdot,e}$ and so joint government welfare will not be at its globally optimal level. The trade agreement the governments choose will be constrained by the ex-ante pressure.

We will see that this change to the government's preferences has the impacts one would expect, at least in the case of tariff caps: net profits for the lobby (weakly) increase, and net political utility for the governments (weakly) decrease.

\subsection{Strong Bindings}
Let us first look at how ex-ante lobbying impacts trade agreements that involve strong bindings, or exact tariff commitments. We know that when there is only ex-post lobbying, $e^{EP} =0$ and $\tau^{EP} = \tau^R_{S,e}$. Since ex-ante effort will be sunk ex-post, the ex-post stage of the game that includes ex-ante lobbying is identical. In the case of exact tariff commitments, because $e^{EP} = 0 \ \forall e^{EA}$, the lobby does not consider the impact of ex-ante lobbying on the ex-post effort level.

This thus looks like a problem with no ex-post lobbying, but where there is perfect enforcement of the tariff commitment. This collapses to a simple problem of maximizing joint government welfare with $e=e^{EA}$, and the lobby maximizing profits net of ex-ante effort facing the joint maximization of the governments.

Without knowing how government welfare varies in $\ga$, we can't say for sure the effect on government welfare at the ex-ante stage. As with the example in Figure~\ref{fig:weight}, joint welfare could fall but could also rise. Ex-post political pressure will not match ex-ante political pressure: because of the incentives involved with exact tariff commitments, the home government will experience $\ga(0)$ but be forced to apply the ex-ante tariff, so this is a welfare loss relative to the no ex-ante case at this stage.\footnote{This is a government welfare loss from exact tariff commitments that is not accounted for in \Textcite{mrc2007} because of their assumption that the government has no bargaining power. It seems to be closely related that, in their model,  exact tariff commitments and tariff caps are equivalent in the case of perfectly immobile capital. As will be shown below, that is not the case here.} There is a very clear gain for the lobby; it there were not, it can always set $e^{EA}=0$.
				
\subsection{Weak Bindings}
In the case of weak bindings, or tariff caps, the ex-post stage will also work as in the no-ex-ante-lobbying case, that is, as in Section~\ref{sec:weak}, again because ex-ante effort is sunk at the ex-post stage. To recap, when there is no ex-ante lobbying---or ex-ante-lobbying is less important than ex-post lobbying---the governments choose the $\tau^R_{W,e}$ that leads to the level of ex-post political pressure that maximizes ex-ante joint welfare
		\[
		  W(\ga(e^R_{W,e})),\tau^R_{W,e}) + W^*(\tau^R_{W,e})
		\]
		knowing that the home government will set the applied tariff in the third stage unilaterally (i.e. $\tau^N(\ga(e^R_{W,e})) = \frac{8\ga(e^R_{W,e}) - 5}{68 - 8 \ga(e^R_{W,e})} = \tau^R_{W,e}$).
						
What is different here is that the tariff cap could be set higher than this level because of the presence of ex-ante lobbying. The lobby chooses its ex-ante effort level $e^{EA}$ taking into account that the governments will set either the optimal ex-post tariff cap $\tau^R_{W,e}$ or a higher cap in ex-ante stage given the $e^{EA}$ with which it is confronted.

The lobby maximimizes $\pi(\tau^E(e^{EA})) - e^{EA} - e^{EP}(e^{EA})$, with a first order condition of 
	\begin{equation}
	  \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial \tau} \frac{\partial \tau^E}{\partial \ga} \frac{\partial \ga}{\partial e^{EA}} = 1 +\frac{\partial e^{EP}}{\partial e^{EA}}
			\label{eq:ea}
	\end{equation}
This condition illustrates that, when it is operative, the governments choose the tariff cap according to Expression~\ref{exp:1} with $e^{EA}$, but then lobby still has to exert effort ex-post to receive the applied tariff. $e^{EP}$ is the amount the lobby pays according to Equation~\ref{eq:nash} to achieve $\tau^E(e^{EA})$ (see Equation~\ref{eq:eff}).

The lobby sets $e^{EA}$ according to this condition as long as 
	\begin{equation}
		\pi(\tau^E(e^{EA})) - e^{EA} - e^{EP}(e^{EA}) > \pi(\tau^N(e^R_{W,e})) - e^R_{W,e}.
		\label{ine:ea}
	\end{equation}
Otherwise, it maximizes net profits by setting $e^{EA} =0$.	

Thus if the lobby's incentives to exert pressure ex-ante are strong enough, they overpower the government's ability to use the trade agreement to directly manipulate lobbying incentives ex-post. The lobby can force the government to set a cap higher than the level that would optimize its welfare when there is no ex-ante lobbying. It has no interest in a lower cap and can choose a zero effort level whenever positive effort would reduce its nets profits below the level with ex-post lobbying only. Therefore we have the following reesult:
		
\begin{result}
	When trade agreements take the form of weak bindings, the binding under ex-ante lobbying can only be (weakly) higher than when ex-ante lobbying is not possible. This can only (weakly) reduce the joint political welfare of the governments and it can only (weakly) increase net profits for the lobby.
\end{result}

\subsection{The Role of Trade Agreements with Ex-Ante Lobbying}				
To understand the function trade agreements serve in the presence of ex-ante lobbying when lobbying is endogenous, it is helpful to establish some facts about the levels at which tariff are set under various scenarios.

\begin{lemma}
  Trade agreements with ex-post lobbying lead to weakly lower tariffs (when bindings are either strong or weak) than those that are applied in the absence of an agreement.
	\label{lem:1}
\end{lemma}

See the \hyperlink{lem1}{Appendix} for the proof. Intuitively, both the terms-of-trade and domestic-commitment motives drive the governments to chose a (weakly) lower tariff than that which the home government chooses when there is no agreement.

It has been established above that the presence of ex-ante lobbying can only weakly increase tariffs from the ex-post agreement level with both strong and weak bindings. Lemma~\ref{lem:1} only establishes that the tariffs with ex-post lobbying are lower than the tariffs with no agreement; we would like to be able to derive a clear result comparing the tariff level with ex-ante lobbying to that with no agreement as well. Lemma~\ref{lem:2} does just that.

\begin{lemma}
  When bindings are weak, trade agreements with ex-ante lobbying lead to strictly lower tariffs than those that are applied in the absence of an agreement. When bindings are strong, tariffs with ex-ante lobbying may be either higher or lower than those that are applied in the absence of an agreement.
	\label{lem:2}
\end{lemma}

See the \hyperlink{lem1}{Appendix} for the proof. The key insight here is that $\frac{\partial \ga}{\partial e}$ is higher ex-ante for any given $e$ than it is ex-post. With stronger incentives on the margin ex-ante, we must rule out that the lobby exerts sufficiently more effort to overcome the internalization of the terms of trade externality that occurs through the trade agreement negotiation. The fact that the lobby must pay a second time is sufficient to mute its incentives at the ex-ante stage in the case of weak bindings; because it pays nothing at the ex-post stage with strong bindings, it is possible (although unlikely) that the heightened incentives on the margin could lead to sufficient effort to produce a higher trade agreement tariff than that which the lobby would achieve with unilateral tariff setting. 

	
		\begin{itemize}
			
			
			
		\item Result: then tariffs are always lower with a trade agreement.
			Proof: It is shown above that tariffs under ex-ante lobbying are set either in line with lobbying effort according to the first order condition (\ref{eq:ea}) or via ex-post incentives. 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Assume throughout that $\frac{\partial \ga}{\partial e} > 0$
				\end{itemize}
			\item Even though ex-ante lobbying takes something away, as long as government \textit{wants} to restrain lobbying, trade agreement will do this even with ex-ante lobbying (relative to trade war level)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item If gov't wants more pressure, it should avoid trade agreement. But then loses TOT internalization
					\item If gov't wants less pressure, trade agreementdoubly good
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Presumes gov't is free to choose which sectors are part of trade agreement, but this is part of a more complicated game; should be able to get payments to leave them out, then payments for unconstrained protection. But GATT rules...
							\item Cross industry, it's possible that $\ga$ affects $W$ the same for all industries ($i$), but that the shape of $\ga$ differs by $i$
							\item Remember what $\ga$ is: reduced form for how political pressure translates into weight put on profits in policy-making process
							\item This would inform who gets included / left out of trade agreements
						\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		
\begin{itemize}					
	\item trade agreement mutes lobbying incentives, even if there is ex-ante lobbying
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ex-ante lobbying is more expensive: both on the margin, and because you have to pay twice in order to get more protection than in ex-post only case
			\item This will be too expensive for some, so they won't lobby ex-ante (see Condition~\ref{ine:ea})
			\item This is part of what trade agreements do: relative to no agreement at all, raises price of protection. If only ex-post lobbying is rational, government gets control
		\end{itemize}

		
	 \item It's possible that $e^{EP} < e^{L}$ with $e^{EA} > 0$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For instance, take $W$ concave in $\ga$ (and $\ga^* < \ga^L$)
			\item This implies $W$ increases as $\pi_x$ is weighted more heavily (as in standard $W$), but eventually $W$ decreases in $\ga$
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Giving them more weight doesn't give gov't proportionally higher welfare
					\item Something like Bill Ethier's 2012 GJE (Political Economy Approach) paper where there are diminishing returns to lobbying as $\tau$ increases
					\item I can interpret this as $\ga$ being a decreasing function of $\tau$
					%\item diminishing returns to lobbying in $\tau$ for lobbyists vs. diminishing returns to awarding higher $\tau$ for gov't
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



		
\newpage
\vskip.2in
Compare to ex-ante lobbying \`{a} la MRC.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cooperative bargaining soln (maximize joint welfare of both governments and both lobbies) instead of extensive form
		\begin{itemize}
			\item leads to bizarre outcome where government will take into account lobby's profits even if $e^{\text{EA}}=0$.
		\end{itemize}
	\item In MRC main treatment, assume lobby has all the bargaining power
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Implies tariff caps and strong bindings equivalent, even though these split the surplus in very different ways. All surplus goes to lobby
			\item In the part that is only in the NBER working paper, they have
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $z=0$ (perfectly immobile capital)
					\item no ex-ante lobbying
					\item government has all the bargaining power
					\item government sometimes chooses free trade---so there IS an incentive to use the trade agreement as a domestic commitment device
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
	\item In MRC, no matter how tariff is set (cooperatively or non-cooperatively), contribution is $xp(\ov{t})$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Not true in GH95
			\item In my set-up, lobby's incentives change when tariff-setting process changes
		\end{itemize}
	\item In MRC, weight on lobby's profits is $1+a$ no matter what. Doesn't vary in lobby's efforts. GH not really microfoundations for flexible model as in Long and Vousden (1991) / Baldwin (1987) model; microfoundations for more restrictive version with fixed weights; then decide $\tau$ to change PS, CS, etc. (p. 481 GH94). Can't get shocks as in this literature
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I still don't know exactly why you never want to reign in lobbying in GH; because it's just a conduit for information, and gov't is fully compensated for loss? But is it?
		\end{itemize}
